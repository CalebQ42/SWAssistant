[![Crowdin](https://badges.crowdin.net/swrpg/localized.svg)](https://crowdin.com/project/swrpg)

An app for the Star Wars RPG from Fantasy Flight Games. Available on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apps.darkstorm.swrpg.assistant) and on [the web](https://darkstorm.tech/SWAssistant). Uses the custom backend [found here](https://github.com/CalebQ42/swassistant-backend).

The app is officially supported for Android, Web (PWA), and Linux Desktop. Each platform may be missing certain features (such as Google Drive not available on Linux Desktop and local saving on web). In theory, all platforms supported by Flutter _should_ work, but they are "unsupported", though if you decide to build it for another platform and something is broken, I'd be glad to try to fix it.

## Features  

* Keep Character, Minion, and Vehicle information
  * Keep notes too!
* Dice!
  * Combines the output so you don't have to do it yourself
* Auto-determine dice for skills and weapons.
* GM Mode that allows for easily switching between multiple profiles.
* Sync everything up to Google Drive for use on multiple devices.
* Share your profiles with others.
