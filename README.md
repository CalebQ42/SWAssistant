An app for the Star Wars RPG from Fantasy Flight Games. Available on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apps.darkstorm.swrpg.assistant) and on [the web](https://darkstorm.tech/SWAssistant).

The app is primarily made for Android and PWA, but it _should_ also compile for desktop OSes (tested on Linux), but this is by no mean "supported" (though I'm glad to fix any issues encountered) and will have a reduced amount of features.

## Features  

* Keep Character, Minion, and Vehicle information
  * Keep notes too!
* Dice!
  * Combines the output so you don't have to do it yourself
* Auto-determine dice for skills and weapons.
* GM Mode that allows for easily switching between multiple profiles.
* Sync everything up to Google Drive for use on multiple devices.
